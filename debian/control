Description: Basic Analysis and Security Engine
 BASE is based on the code from the Analysis Console for Intrusion Databases
 (ACID) project. This application provides a web front-end to query and analyze
 the alerts coming from a SNORT IDS system.
 .
 BASE is a web interface to perform analysis of intrusions that snort has
 detected on your network. It uses a user authentication and role-base system,
 so that you as the security admin can decide what and how much information
 each user can see.
