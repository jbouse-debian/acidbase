This package uses dpatch to manage all modifications to the upstream
source. Changes are stored in the source package as diffs in
debian/patches and applied during the build.

To get the fully patched source after unpacking the source package, cd
to the root level of the source package and run:

    debian/rules patch

Removing a patch is as simple as removing its entry from the
debian/patches/00list file, and please also remove the patch file
itself.

Creating a new patch is done with "dpatch-edit-patch patch XX_patchname"
where you should replace XX with a new number and patchname with a
descriptive shortname of the patch. You can then simply edit all the
files your patch wants to edit, and then simply "exit 0" from the shell
to actually create the patch file.

To tweak an already existing patch, call "dpatch-edit-patch XX_patchname"
and replace XX_patchname with the actual filename from debian/patches
you want to use.

To clean up afterwards again, "debian/rules unpatch" will do the
work for you - or you can of course choose to call
"fakeroot debian/rules clean" all together.
