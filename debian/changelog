acidbase (1.2.7-2) unstable; urgency=high

  * Urgency high, prevents this package from being removed from sid and
    fixes an RC bug.
  * Remove the dependency on php-image-color (Closes: #402406)
    - remove the link from base_main.php to base_graph_main.php
    - do not include base_graph_form.php in base_main.php
    - modify base_graph_common.php so that it does not complain so loudly when
      Image/Graph is not found. Just say that the functionality is currently
      not available in Debian (due to license issues, point to the Bug
      report) and say that users that need it will have to install the PEAR
      modules.
     - document in NEWS.Debian why the graphs have been removed and when will
     they be reenabled in the front page.
  * Workaround for the name change in dbconfig-common, the base_conf.php
    script will substitute 'pgsql' with 'postgres'. This makes it possible
    to setup a PostgreSQL configuration properly. (Closes: #402868)
  * Introduce a space before the Homepage

acidbase (1.2.5-1) unstable; urgency=high

  * New upstream release, wich includes the following security improvements:
     + Added XSSPrintSafe() (array safe htmlspecilchars() function) and made 
       filterSql() use ADOdb qmagic()
     + Filtered all unfiltred (mainly auth system stuff) $_POST and $_GET
       variables using filterSql()
     + Santized all $_SERVER variables to be protected against XSS attacks

       (Closes: #363548).

  * Remove ucf file under /etc/acidbase on package purge.

 -- David Gil <dgil@telefonica.net>  Mon, 12 Jun 2006 21:20:37 +0200

acidbase (1.2.4-1) unstable; urgency=high

  * New upstream release, which fixes many bugs including the following security bug: 
    - base_maintenance.php in BASE before 1.2.4 (melissa), when running in
      standalone mode, allows remote attackers to bypass authentication,
      possibly by setting the standalone parameter to "yes".
      This fixes CVE-2006-1505 (Closes: #361139.)
  * Added patch to fix a warning replacing strings in CleanVariable:
    - debian/patches/03_fix_warning_in_CleanVariable.dpatch: added.

  [ David Gil ]
  * New upstream release.

  [ Javier Fernandez-Sanguino Pen~a ]
  * SECURITY FIX:
    Add proper filtering in all ImportHTTP variables using either the new
    functions to check for numeric/alphanumeric chars or the filterSql()

    but also other attack vectors not mentioned in the initial advisory
    (http://www.frsirt.com/english/advisories/2005/2188)
    (Closes: #336788)
  * To reduce the risk of possible vulnerabilities in the code, made the
    default apache.conf allow access only from localhost and document this
    in the (new) README.Debian file
  * Added dependency on "debconf | debconf-2.0"
  * Added alternative DNS lookups at Sam Spade
  * Changed default alert database in debconf prompt to 'snort_log'

  [ Javier Fernandez-Sanguino Pen~a ]
  * Applied patches included in the acidlab package that apply to this
    package too:
