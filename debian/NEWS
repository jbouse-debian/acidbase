acidbase (1.2.7-2) unstable; urgency=low

  Since this version acidbase no longer provides the graphing functionality
  (previously provided by the PEAR Image_Graph and Image_Color modules) since,
  due to license issues, the Image_Color module cannot be distributed in
  Debian.

  Consequentely, the graphing capabilities are no longer presented in 
  Acidbase's main page although the php pages are there.

  For more information please see bugs #401797 and #402406
